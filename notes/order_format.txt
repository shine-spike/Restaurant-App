ID,	Argument1, Argument2, Argument3...
ORD,	Table #, Menu_item, substitution1, substitution2...
SEEN,	Order_number
READY,Order_number 
REC,	Ingredient, num_received
CON,	Order_number
RET,	Order_number, reason
REDO,	Order_number, reason
BILL,	Table #
PAID,	Table #

The order is as follows:
ORD -> SEEN
SEEN -> READY
READY -> REDO, RET, CON 
(REDO if there's something wrong and we fix it, RET if there's something wrong and we don't, and CON if everything goes well)
REDO -> ORD
CON -> BILL
BILL -> PAID
REC comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. It happens if we receive ingredients.
