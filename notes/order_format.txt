ORD,	ID, Table #, Menu_item, substitution1, substitution2...
SEEN,	ID, Order_number
READY,ID, Order_number 
REC,	ID, Ingredient, num_received
CON,	ID, Order_number
RET,	ID, Order_number, reason
REDO,	ID, Order_number, reason
BILL,	ID, Table #
PAID,	ID, Table #

The order is as follows:
ORD -> SEEN
SEEN -> READY
READY -> REDO, RET, CON 
(REDO if there's something wrong and we fix it, RET if there's something wrong and we don't, and CON if everything goes well)
REDO -> ORD
CON -> BILL
BILL -> PAID
REC comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. It happens if we receive ingredients.
